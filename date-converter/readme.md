Persian to Gregorian Date Converter

A dual-version web-based date conversion application built with HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript

This project provides two separate implementations for converting Persian (Jalali) dates to Gregorian dates. One version uses PHP for server-side conversion, and the other uses JavaScript for client-side conversion. The Persian calendar is widely used in Iran, and accurate date conversion is essential for many web applications, registration flows, international platforms, and data processing tasks. Both versions are lightweight, fast, and easy to integrate into any web project.
